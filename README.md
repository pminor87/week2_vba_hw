## Summary
### What are the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code?
#### Advantages
- Refactoring code can be a significant time save when you don't have to start from scratch.
- It can also help you to improve upon an earlier code you created by consolidating and simplifying it.
- It can also save you from make simple mistakes or errors in the code if you already have a code that is working.

#### Disadvantages
- If you are refactoring a code you haven't written yourself it can be easy to make mistakes or break the code.
- It can be difficult to refactor a code that you do not fully understand as well.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
- The original code gave me a solid structure to build upon and saved me a lot of time with not having to rewrite tedious scripts.
- It also helped keep my thoughts organized with how the code logic was working and what I wanted to accomplish with it.
- The cons would include the fact that some of the scripts may be redundant and knowing which ones can be deleted and which to keep can be confusing to make sure you don't break the subroutine.
